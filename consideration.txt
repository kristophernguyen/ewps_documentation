Performance concerns may arise during the parsing of SAS datasets and the persistence of data into Oracle. To address this, it is recommended to consider replacing certain technology stacks to alleviate potential bottlenecks:

REDIS: A robust distributed cache engine that can be employed to temporarily store parsed data before writing it into Oracle's permanent tables. Another advantage of using REDIS is its ability to manage data archiving. This caching mechanism can be configured to automatically archive data at specific dates and times.

REDIS Queue: While utilizing FAST API's background task functionality may suffice for the immediate requirements, it's important to note that FAST API's background tasks are not entirely asynchronous if synchronous implementations exist in the code. Consequently, this might result in blocking requests for the duration of execution. To mitigate this, considering the adoption of REDIS RQ could be more beneficial. Redis RQ, a simple Python library, facilitates job queuing and background job processing by employing worker processes. When a new job is submitted, it runs as a true background process.

Uvicorn: Enhancing performance with Uvicorn can involve utilizing multiple workers (e.g., running 'uvicorn main:app --workers 4'). This configuration allows for parallel processing of computations, enabling up to 4 simultaneous long computations.
