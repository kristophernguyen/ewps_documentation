When creating a wizard for GitLab CI/CD configuration, you'll need to gather information about the build environment, dependencies, and build steps. Here are specific questions you can include to help users configure the GitLab Runner:

1. **Programming Language and Version:**
   - Which programming language is your project written in?
   - What version of the programming language are you using?

2. **Build Script:**
   - Would you like to use a predefined build script, or do you want to provide a custom script?
   - If predefined, provide options based on common build tools (e.g., Maven, Gradle, npm, pip).
   - If custom, allow users to input their build script.

3. **Dependency Management:**
   - Do you have a dependency management tool (e.g., npm, Maven, pip)?
   - If yes, specify the tool and version.
   - Provide an option for users to specify dependency installation commands.

4. **Build Environment:**
   - Do you need a specific build environment (e.g., Java JDK, Node.js)?
   - If yes, specify the required environment and version.

5. **Unit Testing:**
   - Would you like to include unit tests in your CI/CD pipeline?
   - If yes, specify the testing framework (e.g., JUnit, NUnit, pytest).
   - Provide an option to specify the command for running unit tests.

6. **Code Quality:**
   - Would you like to include code quality checks in your CI/CD pipeline?
   - If yes, specify the code quality tool (e.g., ESLint, SonarQube).
   - Provide an option to specify the command for code quality checks.

7. **Additional Build Steps:**
   - Are there any additional build steps or commands you would like to include?

8. **Artifact Generation:**
   - Do you want to generate artifacts as part of the build process?
   - If yes, specify the location and type of artifacts.

9. **Docker Configuration (if applicable):**
   - Are you using Docker in your build process?
   - If yes, specify Docker-related configurations.

10. **Build Cache:**
    - Do you want to use build caching to speed up subsequent builds?
    - If yes, specify cache paths or patterns.

Creating a wizard for groups with limited technical resources can be a great idea to simplify the process of setting up CI/CD pipelines, especially when working with platforms like GitLab. It can help users who may not be familiar with the intricacies of configuration files to adopt CI/CD practices more easily. However, there are a few considerations to keep in mind:

**Pros:**

1. **User-Friendly Experience:** A wizard provides a user-friendly and guided experience, making it accessible to individuals with varying technical backgrounds.

2. **Reduced Entry Barrier:** Users with limited technical expertise can benefit from a wizard that abstracts away complex configuration details, reducing the entry barrier to adopting CI/CD.

3. **Consistent Configurations:** A wizard ensures that configurations are consistent and follow best practices, reducing the likelihood of errors due to manual misconfigurations.

4. **Time Savings:** Users can save time and effort by using a wizard rather than manually crafting CI/CD configuration files.

**Cons:**

1. **Limited Flexibility:** Wizards might not cover all possible use cases or configurations. Advanced users might find them limiting in terms of customization.

2. **Dependency on Wizard Updates:** The wizard needs to be regularly updated to support new tools, languages, and best practices in CI/CD.

3. **Understanding Dependencies:** While the wizard abstracts away complexity, users may benefit from understanding the basics of CI/CD and the purpose of the configurations.

4. **Educational Aspect:** For users who wish to learn more, the wizard should ideally provide links or explanations for educational purposes.

**Recommendations:**

1. **User Feedback and Testing:** Gather feedback from users who represent the target audience and conduct usability testing to ensure the wizard meets their needs.

2. **Educational Resources:** Provide links to educational resources or tooltips that explain the purpose of certain configurations, helping users understand the underlying concepts.

3. **Balanced Approach:** Aim for a balanced approach that caters to both beginners and users who might want more control over the configurations.

4. **Community Engagement:** Encourage community engagement to collect feedback, address issues, and improve the wizard over time.

Overall, creating a wizard for users with limited technical resources can be a valuable tool, provided it is designed with their needs in mind and is accompanied by educational resources for those who wish to learn more.
