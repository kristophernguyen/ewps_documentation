When creating a wizard for GitLab CI/CD configuration, you'll need to gather information about the build environment, dependencies, and build steps. Here are specific questions you can include to help users configure the GitLab Runner:

1. **Programming Language and Version:**
   - Which programming language is your project written in?
   - What version of the programming language are you using?

2. **Build Script:**
   - Would you like to use a predefined build script, or do you want to provide a custom script?
   - If predefined, provide options based on common build tools (e.g., Maven, Gradle, npm, pip).
   - If custom, allow users to input their build script.

3. **Dependency Management:**
   - Do you have a dependency management tool (e.g., npm, Maven, pip)?
   - If yes, specify the tool and version.
   - Provide an option for users to specify dependency installation commands.

4. **Build Environment:**
   - Do you need a specific build environment (e.g., Java JDK, Node.js)?
   - If yes, specify the required environment and version.

5. **Unit Testing:**
   - Would you like to include unit tests in your CI/CD pipeline?
   - If yes, specify the testing framework (e.g., JUnit, NUnit, pytest).
   - Provide an option to specify the command for running unit tests.

6. **Code Quality:**
   - Would you like to include code quality checks in your CI/CD pipeline?
   - If yes, specify the code quality tool (e.g., ESLint, SonarQube).
   - Provide an option to specify the command for code quality checks.

7. **Additional Build Steps:**
   - Are there any additional build steps or commands you would like to include?

8. **Artifact Generation:**
   - Do you want to generate artifacts as part of the build process?
   - If yes, specify the location and type of artifacts.

9. **Docker Configuration (if applicable):**
   - Are you using Docker in your build process?
   - If yes, specify Docker-related configurations.

10. **Build Cache:**
    - Do you want to use build caching to speed up subsequent builds?
    - If yes, specify cache paths or patterns.

Remember that the questions should be structured in a logical order, and each question should guide the user to provide the necessary information for configuring the GitLab Runner. Additionally, provide helpful hints or links to documentation where users can find more information about specific configurations.
