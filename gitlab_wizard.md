When creating a wizard for GitLab CI/CD configuration, you'll need to gather information about the build environment, dependencies, and build steps. Here are specific questions you can include to help users configure the GitLab Runner:

1. **Programming Language and Version:**
   - Which programming language is your project written in?
   - What version of the programming language are you using?

2. **Build Script:**
   - Would you like to use a predefined build script, or do you want to provide a custom script?
   - If predefined, provide options based on common build tools (e.g., Maven, Gradle, npm, pip).
   - If custom, allow users to input their build script.

3. **Dependency Management:**
   - Do you have a dependency management tool (e.g., npm, Maven, pip)?
   - If yes, specify the tool and version.
   - Provide an option for users to specify dependency installation commands.

   - If yes, specify the required environment and version.

5. **Unit Testing:**
   - Would you like to include unit tests in your CI/CD pipeline?
   - If yes, specify the testing framework (e.g., JUnit, NUnit, pytest).
   - Provide an option to specify the command for running unit tests.

6. **Code Quality:**
   - Would you like to include code quality checks in your CI/CD pipeline?
   - If yes, specify the code quality tool (e.g., ESLint, SonarQube).
   - Provide an option to specify the command for code quality checks.

7. **Additional Build Steps:**
   - Are there any additional build steps or commands you would like to include?

8. **Artifact Generation:**
   - Do you want to generate artifacts as part of the build process?
   - If yes, specify the location and type of artifacts.

Unfortunately, I cannot generate images or visual representations directly. However, I can guide you on how you might create a visual representation of the CI/CD flow using a simple textual representation.

You can use ASCII art or text diagrams to create a visual representation. Here's a very basic example:

```plaintext
+------------------------+    +------------------------+    +------------------------+
|   Project Information  | -> |    Version Control     | -> |   Build Configuration   |
+------------------------+    +------------------------+    +------------------------+
             |                                |                               |
             v                                v                               v
+------------------------+    +------------------------+    +------------------------+
|      Unit Testing      | <- |      Code Quality      | <- |    Security Scanning   |
+------------------------+    +------------------------+    +------------------------+
             |                                |                               |
             v                                v                               v
+------------------------+    +------------------------+    +------------------------+
|    Containerization    | -> |      Deployment        | -> |       Notifications     |
+------------------------+    +------------------------+    +------------------------+
             |                                                                     |
             v                                                                     |
+------------------------+                                                         |
|     Review and Generate | ------------------------------------------------------+
+------------------------+
             |
             v
+------------------------+
| Download and Use       |
| Instructions           |
+------------------------+
```

This is a very simplified and textual representation. In a more sophisticated tool or application, you might use graphical elements, connecting lines, and icons to create a more visually appealing flowchart or diagram.

For creating actual visual representations, you might consider using tools like draw.io, Lucidchart, or even designing it using graphic software like Adobe Illustrator, Figma, or Sketch. These tools allow you to create flowcharts with more sophisticated graphics and layouts.
