Although, the design of background job is independent from one another.  They follow a very similar design pattern and framework.  The starting point of each background job (i.e Transfer CE, Load CE, etc) is API/router.  Authentication/authorization takes place at the router level.  The router validate the authenticity of each request and it will either reject with a status code of 405 (Unauthorized) or 400 (bad request).  Once successfully authenticated the user, the application uses dependency injection to inject data setting, data access classes to the main service class itself.  The final step is to call validate and execute method from the service class.
