While the design of background jobs is distinct for each job, they all adhere to a consistent design pattern and framework. Each background job, such as Transfer CE and Load CE, follows a similar structure. The initiation of each background job begins at the API/router level, serving as the entry point. Authentication and authorization procedures are conducted at this router level. Here, requests are validated for authenticity, and if unsuccessful, they are either rejected with a 405 (Unauthorized) or 400 (Bad Request) status code.

Once a user is successfully authenticated, the application employs dependency injection to seamlessly integrate data settings and data access classes into the main service class itself. This mechanism ensures that the necessary resources are readily available for the service to execute effectively.

The final stages involve invoking the 'validate' and 'execute' methods within the service class, consolidating the background job's execution process. This approach streamlines the flow from request validation to the execution of the job, maintaining a consistent and manageable structure across all background jobs.
