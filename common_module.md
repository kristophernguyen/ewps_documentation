Having been digging through common module code the past few days, I came to the conclusion that we canâ€™t really use this package unless we have the same table structure as EST.    The current common module uses EST_REF_COL_VALIDATE table for table columns mapping.  I wish we know these requirements at the beginning of this sprint.  Anyhow, I still think that this module brings lots of other great features that will be very useful in the coming sprint.  As of right now, I will refactor the module and make minimal changes so we can complete the load story.  Future stories will include effort to refactor common module.
