Having been digging through common module code the past few days, I came to the conclusion that we canâ€™t really use this package unless we have the same table structure as EST.    The current common module uses EST_REF_COL_VALIDATE table for table columns mapping.  I wish we know these requirements at the beginning of this sprint.  Anyhow, I still think that this module brings lots of other great features that will be very useful in the coming sprint.  As of right now, I will refactor the module and make minimal changes so we can complete the load story.  Future stories will include effort to refactor common module.

Having delved into the common module code in recent days, I've concluded that we can't effectively use this package unless we have the same table structure as EST. The current common module uses the EST_REF_COL_VALIDATE table for mapping table columns. I wish we had known these requirements at the beginning of this sprint. Despite this, I still believe this module brings many other great features that will be useful in the upcoming sprint. Right now, I will refactor the module and name it "EWPS_COMMON_MODULE," making minimal changes to ensure we can complete the load story. Future stories will involve efforts to further refactor the common module.
